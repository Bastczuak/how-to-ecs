# How to ECS (Entity Component System)
A little example in `Rust` for creating a "game"
with [specs](https://github.com/amethyst/specs).
This was just for me to better understand how to split things
into components and what systems to use.

If you want to try it out you have to install `SDL2` and `SDL2_IMAGE` first
and then run `cargo run`.

Credits goes to [sunjay](https://github.com/sunjay) for providing a code 
tutorial on this topic which I just copied.
